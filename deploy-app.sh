# This script automates the deployment process for the Express.js + MongoDB application on Minikube.
# It handles the complete workflow from building the Docker image to making the app accessible.
# 
# Why this file exists:
# - Eliminates manual steps and reduces deployment errors
# - Ensures consistent deployment process across different environments
# - Provides interactive options for port-forwarding
# - Saves time by automating repetitive tasks

set -e  # Exit immediately if any command fails

# Configuration variables - easily modifiable for different environments

echo "üëâ Switching Docker to Minikube's Docker daemon..."
# This is crucial for Minikube - it ensures the Docker image is built inside Minikube's Docker daemon
# so Kubernetes can find and use the local image without pulling from external registries

# Build the production-ready Docker image with the latest code changes

echo "üîÑ Restarting Express.js deployment in namespace $NAMESPACE"
# Force a rolling restart to pick up the new Docker image
# This is more reliable than deleting/recreating pods

# Wait for the new pods to be fully ready before proceeding
# This prevents issues where the app might not be fully functional yet
